## Linear Notification Types

Universal Inbox collects several types of Linear notifications:

- **Issue Assignment**: Notifications when issues are assigned to you
- **Issue Comment**: Comments on issues you're involved with
- **Issue Status Change**: Updates when issue statuses change
- **Project Update**: Updates on projects you're participating in
- **Mention**: Direct mentions in issues or comments

## Available Actions

### Actions on notifications

The following actions apply to all Linear notifications from the [Inbox screen](../../quick_start/inbox_screen.md):

#### View in Linear

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Enter`
- **Effect**: Opens the notification source (ie. issue or project) in Linear

This action lets you view the full context of the notification directly in Linear, where you can respond to comments, update issues, or participate in project discussions.

#### Delete

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `d`
- **Effect in Universal Inbox**: Removes the notification from your inbox until the next update
- **Effect in Linear**: Delete all the notifications of the issue or project

Use this action when you want to clear a notification from your Universal Inbox and Linear. The notification will reappear if updated in Linear.

#### Unsubscribe

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `u`
- **Effect in Universal Inbox**: Removes the notification from your inbox
- **Effect in Linear**: Unsubscribes you from the issue, preventing future notifications. It can still be re-subscribed to if you are directly pinged in the issue or project.

This action helps reduce notification noise by unsubscribing you from issues that aren't relevant to your work.

#### Snooze

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `s`
- **Effect in Universal Inbox**: Temporarily hides the notification for a few hours
- **Effect in Linear**: Linear notifications are also snoozed for the same duration

Use this when you need to defer handling a notification until later.

#### Create Task

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `p`
- **Keyboard Shortcut (with default task parameters)**: `t`
- **Effect in Universal Inbox**: Links notification to a newly created task and remove the notification from your inbox
- **Effect in Linear**: Delete all the notifications of the issue or project
- **Effect in Task Manager**: Creates a new task with a link to the Linear issue or project

Ideal for converting a Linear notification into an actionable task in your task management tool, especially when you want to track it outside of Linear.

#### Link to Task

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `l`
- **Effect in Universal Inbox**: Links notification to an existing task and remove the notification from your inbox
- **Effect in Linear**: Delete all the notifications of the issue or project
- **Effect in Task Manager**: Add a link to the Linear issue or project in the task description

Use this when you already have a task related to this Linear notification.
