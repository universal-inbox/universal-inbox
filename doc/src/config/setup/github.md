## Notification Synchronization

The GitHub integration imports your [GitHub notifications](https://github.com/notifications) into Universal Inbox, giving you a centralized place to manage all your GitHub activity.

### What Gets Synchronized

You receive GitHub notifications for various activities you're subscribed to:

- **Conversations**: Comments on issues, pull requests, or gists
- **Repository Activity**: Updates in repositories you watch
- **CI/CD**: Status updates from GitHub Actions workflows
- **Repository Content**: Issues, pull requests, releases, security alerts, and discussions (if enabled)

### Managing Your Subscriptions

To control which GitHub notifications you receive, visit GitHub's documentation on [managing your subscriptions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/managing-your-subscriptions).

## Available Actions

With the GitHub integration, you can perform these actions directly from Universal Inbox:

- View detailed notification content
- Mark notifications as read/unread
- Unsubscribe from future updates
- Convert notifications to tasks in your task management tool
