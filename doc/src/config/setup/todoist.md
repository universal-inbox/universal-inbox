The Todoist integration is a core component of Universal Inbox, enabling powerful task management capabilities that connect your notifications with your Todoist workflow.

## Key Features

Connecting Todoist with Universal Inbox enables you to:

- **Create Tasks from Notifications**: Convert any notification into a Todoist task with one click
- **Link Notifications to Tasks**: Associate existing notifications with tasks you've already created
- **Bidirectional Synchronization**: Keep tasks in sync between Todoist and other connected tools
- **Centralized Task Management**: View and update tasks from multiple sources in one interface

## Configuration Options

- **Synchronize Todoist tasks from `#Inbox` as notifications**: When enabled, tasks from your Todoist Inbox project will appear in Universal Inbox's notification feed, allowing you to process them alongside your other notifications.

```admonish tip
This option is particularly useful if you use Todoist's quick-add features or email forwarding to create tasks that need further sorting or organization.
```

## Available Actions

With the Todoist integration, you can:

- Create new Todoist tasks from any notification
- Link existing Todoist tasks to notifications
- Complete tasks from Universal Inbox (status updates in Todoist)
- View task details, including due dates and priorities
