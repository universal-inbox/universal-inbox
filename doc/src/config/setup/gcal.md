## Calendar Invitation Management

The Google Calendar integration extends the [Google Mail integration](gmail.md) to enhance your event management workflow. Once enabled, you can respond to calendar invitations directly within Universal Inbox without switching to Google Mail or Google Calendar.

## How It Works

1. **Google Mail Connection Required**: This integration depends on having the Google Mail integration set up and properly configured
2. **Automatic Detection**: Universal Inbox automatically detects calendar invitations in your synchronized emails
3. **Direct Responses**: Accept, tentatively accept, or decline invitations without leaving Universal Inbox

```admonish tip
When you respond to a calendar invitation through Universal Inbox, your Google Calendar is automatically updated with your response status.
```

## Available Actions

With calendar invitations in Universal Inbox, you can:

- **Accept**: Confirm your attendance at the event
- **Maybe**: Indicate tentative attendance
- **Decline**: Reject the invitation
- **View Details**: See event time, location, and other participants
